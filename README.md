# End-to-End ML Project with AWS & Azure Deployment

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a full machine learning workflow deployed on **AWS** and **Azure**. It includes:

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Training ML model(s)  
- Containerization and deployment to cloud platforms (AWS & Azure)  
- Web application or API endpoint for serving predictions  

---

## 🚀 Features

- Cross-cloud deployment: AWS + Azure  
- Experiment artifacts stored under `artifacts/`  
- Use of CatBoost or similar algorithms (as per `catboost_info`)  
- Web templates for UI / frontend (if any)  
- Requirements & setup scripts for reproducibility

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+  
- AWS account (with necessary services: e.g., EC2 / Elastic Beanstalk / S3)  
- Azure account (with equivalent compute / app services)  
- Docker (if building containers)  

### 2️⃣ Installation

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/hariom845/End-to-End-ML-project-with-AWS-Azure-Deployment.git
cd End-to-End-ML-project-with-AWS-Azure-Deployment

# (Optional) Setup virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 🔧 Usage
To Train / Generate Artifacts
python src/train.py
(Adjust the path if your training script is named differently.)
To Run the Application Locally
python application.py

# ☁️ Deployment
AWS

- Use .ebextensions/ for Elastic Beanstalk environment configuration
- Push your application & dependencies via AWS CLI or EB CLI

Azure

- Use Azure App Service / Azure Container Instances / Azure Web Apps to deploy your container or application
- Ensure required environment variables & cloud storage / databases are set

# 📊 Model & Evaluation

- Model metadata is stored in catboost_info/
- Evaluation metrics, logs, etc. are in artifacts/

# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning
- Add monitoring & alerting for deployed models
- Support blue/green or canary deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Expand to serve multiple models or versions simultaneously
